Within this project, we propose to develop a software application, with functionalities in deciphering Morse code and transforming texts into this code. This application will be equipped with the ability to play Morse code in the form of a distinctive beep. It will rely on the rigorous rules and conventions of the Morse code language to accurately perform conversions between human language and Morse code. User interaction will be facilitated through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), which will allow the user to enter text or code for the purpose of decoding or transformation, as well as displaying or playing Morse code as an audio signal, thus contributing to an improved user experience. Also, the application will be able to load morse code audio signals and decode them.
